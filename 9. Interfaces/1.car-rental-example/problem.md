A Brazilian car rental company charges an hourly rate for rentals lasting up to 12 hours.
If the rental duration exceeds 12 hours, a daily rate is applied.
In addition to the rental cost, a tax is added to the price according to the country's regulations.
In the case of Brazil, the tax is 20% for amounts up to 100.00, or 15% for amounts over 100.00.

Create a program that reads:
- Rental data (car model, rental start and end timestamps)
- The hourly and daily rental rates.

The program should then generate a payment invoice containing:
- Rental amount.
- Tax amount.
- Total payment amount.
