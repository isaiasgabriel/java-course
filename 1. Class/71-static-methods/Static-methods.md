# Static methods

- Static methods are methods that don't need an instance to be used.
- You can directly call your class name and use it's function.
- For this, all you have to do is declare it as `static` inside the class.

Details:
- They cannot access non static methods inside the class.
- They cannot use the `this` keyword because there's no instance.
